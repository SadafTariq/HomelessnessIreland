Official homelessness data is produced by local authorities through the Pathway Accommodation and Support System (PASS). PASS was rolled-out nationally during the course of 2013.

The data produced captures details of individuals in State-funded emergency accommodation, arrangements that are overseen by local authorities. For example data on domestic violence refuges is available through Tusla Child and Family Agency. Data on asylum seekers accommodated in direct provision, is available from the Reception and Integration Agency.

The lead local authorities for homelessness in each region provide monthly reports on homelessness which identify the number of people utilising State-funded emergency accommodation on a regional and county basis.

Monthly homelessness data are published to www.housing.gov.ie on the last working Friday of every month. These data are available in open format on www.data.gov.ie and are made available under the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License, and are available for reproduction elsewhere, subject to appropriate credit being given to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.

The administration of homeless services is organised across nine administrative regions i.e., Dublin, Mid-East, Midlands, Mid-West, North-East, North-west, South-East,
South-West and West with one local authority in each of the regions.

For the analysis I extracted the data from the website from year 2016 to 2022 and monthly data for the year 2021 and 2022.
I prepared the data using excel and visualize the data using Power BI platform.
The project includes the following:
